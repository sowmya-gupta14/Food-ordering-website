# Food-ordering-website
it is a website of an online food ordering company. I have clowned the website of xero degrees.
<br>

I have used the idea from the website of xero degrees and I have cloned their 
design but with my abilities and mindset. This website was developed with the aim 
of creating an immersive online experience that aligns with the franchise's brand 
identity and values. It serves as a central hub for information, allowing customers 
to easily access details about the franchise's offerings, including their menu items, 
nutritional information, pricing, and promotions. Furthermore, the website 
provides an avenue for customers to engage with the franchise through online 
ordering, reservations, and feedback mechanisms.
